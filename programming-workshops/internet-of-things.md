## **Workshop Resources**

* **Slack Channel:** _#programming-iot_ in the CxD 2022 Slack Workspace
* **Documentation Link:** [IoT Code Reference and Tutorials 2.0 (Under Development in Summer 2022)](https://docs.idew.org/code-internet-of-things-2.0/)\
  Note: The CxD IoT project provides two online documents. One document for the broader project instructions that include things like research, design and implementation. The second document is a code reference for programming. In this workshop we will focus on the programming and use the _code reference document._\
