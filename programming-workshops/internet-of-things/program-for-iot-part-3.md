# Program for IoT Part 3

## Complete a Custom IoT Project

After completing the particle tutorial, develop a custom application with a subset of the provided hardware that solves a problem **with web-enabled features**. Simple examples (Thermostat and Door Bell) will be posted as we progress. Again, let's share successes and roadblocks liberally in Slack to help each other and inspire ideas.&#x20;

### Thermostat Project Example

## Planning for Student Success

Now that you have experience with programming for this project...

* **Consider how you will approach classroom management when students are completing a tutorial like this one.**&#x20;
  * What will be your expectations?&#x20;
  * How much will be individual work versus team work?
  * Will you assign any code champions to help you support students with questions?
* **How will you supplement it with other programming content or experiences?**
  * Will you use any online tutorials?
  * Will you supplement with any CS unplugged activities?
  * Will you create any custom programming exercises yourself?
