### Background on Computing by Design Framework

**This workshop is focused squarely on the programming component of a CxD Project.** For a little bit of background, you will find that the Computing by Design framework is project-centric in the approach.&#x20;

Each project has three phases, where programming is a very important component of all three. **Our** [**Innovation Workshop**](broken-reference) **covers the breadth of the Computing by Design framework.** We have found that the programming in any project presents a fine line between a wonderfully empowering experience (when students struggle and get things working) and a sometimes frustrating experience that becomes a missed opportunity. Therefore we are offering these programming workshops to provide a solid foundation on building the applications.

### Learning to Program: A Two-Pronged Approach

**We encourage you to offer students a two-pronged approach to learning to program.** Computing by Design projects provide an _**"application first"**_ approach to programming where students are provided direct guidance on creating a specific type of application through templates and tutorials -- like with trivia , a chatbot, IoT etc. This approach complements the many great tutorials available online that provide a _**"concept first"**_ approach by stepping through concepts in programming. Facilitating both approaches for students provides a varied experience -- strengthening knowledge and offering more opportunities to ignite interests.&#x20;

**Identify an online tutorial site that you can use in your classroom to supplement any project work.** Over the course of the workshop try out a few basic online programming tutorials from popular sites to facilitate this _"concept first"_ approach, and consider how you might manage a self-paced assignment based on milestones.  How might you use these self-guided tutorials as "filler time" or dedicate scheduled time to their completion?

## Getting Started with Slack

{% embed url="https://www.loom.com/share/351f4100d55045a0a04b3ec078ffaa39" %}

Slack will be our primary communication platform for the workshop. The video above provides a brief introduction on the features of Slack, but more help and tutorials can be found at [https://slack.com/help](https://slack.com/help).

## Getting Started with Replit

{% embed url="https://www.loom.com/share/cb321527b8d14c3dadd5d5329a6b0d34" %}

Replit is the recommended programming environment for many of our projects. The video above provides a brief introduction on the features of Replit, but more help and tutorials can be found at [https://docs.replit.com/](https://docs.replit.com/).

## Getting Started with Particle Build Editor

{% embed url="https://www.loom.com/share/7c8a97abc88f4ce9a7dc52c4baea92bb" %}

Particle offers a web-based editor ([https://build.particle.io/build/](https://build.particle.io/build/)) that makes programming a device pretty easy. To prepare for the workshop you will want to create a Particle account and know how to access the programming environment. We will get to actually programming a little bit later.
