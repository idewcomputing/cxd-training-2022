# Workshop Deliverables

For the IoT programming workshop we simply request that you submit the following three items in a document.

1. **A link to your working web app code (e.g. replit.com) that connects to your IoT board.**
2. **A copy of your Particle Build code.**
3.  **A summary of your classroom plan**

    * **Consider how you will approach classroom management when students are completing a tutorial like this one.**&#x20;
      * What will be your expectations?&#x20;
      * How much will be individual work versus team work?
      * Will you assign any code champions to help you support students with questions?

    &#x20;

    * **How will you supplement it with other programming content or experiences?**
      * Will you use any online tutorials?
      * Will you supplement with any CS unplugged activities?
      * Will you create any custom programming exercises yourself?
