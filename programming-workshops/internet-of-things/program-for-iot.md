## Claiming Your IoT Device

This video steps you through claiming a particle device and setting up WIFI. You will want your mobile phone to complete this with the Particle App installed. \

## IoT Tutorial

We will use the Particle tutorial for the IoT kit linked below to guide us, but the videos will deviate a bit to demonstrate things using the web programming environment. Ultimately we want to get familiar with the hardware, inputs, sensors, and programming. ‚òÖ **Post questions and successes in our Slack channel as you move along.**

#### **Understanding LED Status Signals**

**This link comes in very handy for interpreting the different status LED signals you may get from time to time.** [**https://docs.particle.io/troubleshooting/led/argon/**](https://docs.particle.io/troubleshooting/led/argon/)****
{% endhint %}

### **Reading Temperature and Humidity**

Covering concepts from the _**Particle Variables: measure temperature & humidity**_ section of the tutorial. _****_ [https://docs.particle.io/quickstart/isk-project/#particle-variables-measure-temperature-amp-humidity](https://docs.particle.io/quickstart/isk-project/#particle-variables-measure-temperature-amp-humidity)

#### 1. Create a new program in Particle build.

#### 2. Connect the temperature and humidity sensor to D2, and have your Argon device connected.

#### 3. Include the "**GROVE\_TEMPERATURE\_AND\_HUMIDITY\_SENSOR" library in your program.**

#### 4. Copy and paste the code below (except of the #include part) into your program.

```arduino
// This #include statement was automatically added by the Particle IDE.
#include <Grove_Temperature_And_Humidity_Sensor.h>

DHT dht(D2);

double temp_dbl, humidity_dbl;

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(9600);

    dht.begin();
    
    Particle.variable("temp", temp_dbl);
    Particle.variable("humidity", humidity_dbl);
}

void loop() {
    float temp, humidity;

    temp = dht.getTempFarenheit();
    humidity = dht.getHumidity();

    temp_dbl = temp;
    humidity_dbl = humidity;

    delay(10000);
}
```

**5. Save, Verify, and Flash the code to the Argon board.**

**6. Open the Console from particle build, select "my devices", and select your Argon.**

**7. Get the temp and humidity variables to check if all is working.**

#### That's it for this step üéâ. If you are having any problems, no worry, post in our slack channel. Please share your code when it makes sense or create videos.

## Complete a Custom IoT Project

After completing the particle tutorial, develop a custom application with a subset of the provided hardware that solves a problem **with web-enabled features**. Simple examples (Thermostat and Door Bell) will be posted as we progress. Again, let's share successes and roadblocks liberally in Slack to help each other and inspire ideas.&#x20;

### Thermostat Project Example

Example code coming soon...

### Door Bell Project Example

Example code coming soon...

## Planning for Student Success

Now that you have experience with programming for this project...

* **Consider how you will approach classroom management when students are completing a tutorial like this one.**&#x20;
  * What will be your expectations?&#x20;
  * How much will be individual work versus team work?
  * Will you assign any code champions to help you support students with questions?
* **How will you supplement it with other programming content or experiences?**
  * Will you use any online tutorials?
  * Will you supplement with any CS unplugged activities?
  * Will you create any custom programming exercises yourself?
