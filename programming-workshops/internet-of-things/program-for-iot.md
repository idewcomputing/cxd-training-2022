## Claiming Your IoT Device

This video steps you through claiming a particle device and setting up WIFI. You will want your mobile phone to complete this with the Particle App installed. \

## IoT Tutorial

We will use the Particle tutorial for the IoT kit to get familiar with the hardware, sensors, and programming. Post questions and successes in our Slack channel as you move along.

## Complete a Custom IoT Project

After completing the particle tutorial, develop a custom application with a subset of the provided hardware that solves a problem **with web-enabled features**. Simple examples (Thermostat and Door Bell) will be posted as we progress. Again, let's share successes and roadblocks liberally in Slack to help each other and inspire ideas.&#x20;

### Thermostat Project Example

Example code coming soon...

### Door Bell Project Example

## Planning for Student Success

Now that you have experience with programming for this project...

* **Consider how you will approach classroom management when students are completing a tutorial like this one.**&#x20;
  * What will be your expectations?&#x20;
  * How much will be individual work versus team work?
  * Will you assign any code champions to help you support students with questions?
* **How will you supplement it with other programming content or experiences?**
  * Will you use any online tutorials?
  * Will you supplement with any CS unplugged activities?
  * Will you create any custom programming exercises yourself?
