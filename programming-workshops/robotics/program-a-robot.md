## Planning for Student Success

Now that you have experience with programming for this project...

* **Consider how you will approach classroom management when students are completing a tutorial like this one.**&#x20;
  * What will be your expectations?&#x20;
  * How much will be individual work versus team work?
  * Will you assign any code champions to help you support students with questions?
* **How will you supplement it with other programming content or experiences?**
  * Will you use any online tutorials?
  * Will you supplement with any CS unplugged activities?
  * Will you create any custom programming exercises yourself?
