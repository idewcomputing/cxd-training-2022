## For Background: The Project Guidebook

While this workshop is focused on the programming aspect of project, you will want to review the full project guide book below to understand the context.

## Three Paths to Visualizations

We offer three paths to work with data and present a visualization, each using a distinct programming language or platform. For your classroom you may choose one path for a single project, all three to provide to facilitate a sequence of projects, or provide students with a choice. Through your own review and work with this material you can determine a best path for your context.

**Complete the web app sequence at a minimum, and then consider reviewing the spreadsheet and python exercises as well.**

{% tab title="Web App (HTML/CSS/JS" %}
The web app applies HTML, CSS, and Javascript with a Spreadsheet (used simply for raw data) to support creating a data dashboard that works in a standard browser. This project is more popular and in depth that the other two options.

### Core Dashboard Tutorial

Complete each of the steps below to get started with a dashboard.

{% tab title="Spreadsheet" %}
The spreadsheet path is a gentler approach to creating a data visualization using a tool that many are comfortable with.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Python" %}
Python is often the choice for professional data scientists and machine learning programmers, making it a great option to onboard students into high-demand disciplines. But this approach may prove to be more difficult to find entry-level coding material online, requiring a more adventurous perspective for beginner or novice programmers.

## Planning for Student Success

Now that you have experience with programming for this project...

* **Consider how you will approach classroom management when students are completing a tutorial like this one.**&#x20;
  * What will be your expectations?&#x20;
  * How much will be individual work versus team work?
  * Will you assign any code champions to help you support students with questions?
* **How will you supplement it with other programming content or experiences?**
  * Will you use any online tutorials?
  * Will you supplement with any CS unplugged activities?
  * Will you create any custom programming exercises yourself?

If you are participating in the [Innovation Workshop](broken-reference) you will consider similar questions for broader project activities.
