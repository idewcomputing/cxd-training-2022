### Programming Workshop Sequence (June 20 - 24, 2022)

**This workshop is largely asynchronous, providing you flexibility to complete things on a schedule that works for you.** Below you will find the sequence of events and videos for the workshop. Notice the two live Zoom sessions on **Monday at 1:00 pm** and **Wednesday at 1:00 pm**. Otherwise we will use Slack for discussions and impromptu Zoom meetings as needed.
