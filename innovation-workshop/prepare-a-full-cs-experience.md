# Prepare a Full CS Experience

### **Welcome and Getting Started**

![](../.gitbook/assets/vidComing.png)

### Prepare for a full-semester PBL experience in computer science engaging the breadth of work in building a product using design, data, and programming.

The Computing by Design Innovation Workshop will cover the development of computer science projects through a three-phase process that goes from researching a problem, building a solution, and evaluating the solution. The project framework and prepared material will provide the guidance needed to plan a semester experience regardless of which technology the project employs.&#x20;

This workshop is part of the CSPD Week for 2022 (June 27 - July 1).
