# Prepare a Full CS Experience

### **Welcome and Getting Started**

![](../.gitbook/assets/vidComing.png)

### Prepare for a full-semester PBL experience in computer science engaging the breadth of work in building a product using design, data, and programming.

The Computing by Design Innovation Workshop will cover the development of computer science projects through a three-phase process that goes from researching a problem, building a solution, and evaluating the solution. The project framework and prepared material will provide the guidance needed to plan a semester experience regardless of which technology the project employs.&#x20;

This workshop is part of the CSPD Week for 2022 (June 27 - July 1).

## Tentative Outline for the Week

Ultimately, we will adapt to make this the most productive time we can for everybody. This workshop is primarily focused on project-based activities for the full development computing products the solve problems, using research, design, prototyping, teamwork, planning, and presentations. While this work shop is not heavily focused on programming ([**we have specific workshops for programming**](https://docs.idew.org/cxd2022/)), we can definitely allocate quality time to programming anything you want.

* **DAY 1 - FOUNDATIONS**
  * Introductions and Survey of Objectives
  * The Computing by Design Approach
  * Problem Solving and Innovation
  * Considerations for Work in the Classroom
  * Getting Started with our Workshop App&#x20;
* **Day 2 - DEFINING PROBLEMS & VALUE PROPOSITIONS**
  * Driving Question for Students: Which problem will you solve and what improvement do you propose?
  * ✓ Problem Definition & Importance │ ✓ Technology Experimentation & Summary
  * ✓ Initial Ideas & Evaluation │ ✓ Existing Solution Analysis
  * ✓ Stakeholder Profiles & Narratives │ ✓ Value Proposition & Potential Features Map
  * ★ PROPOSAL PRESENTATION
* **Day 3 - DESIGNING & BUILDING SOLUTIONS**
  * Driving Question for Students: What specific solution will you provide and how will you design and build it?
  * ✓ Prototypes │ ✓ Prototype Evaluations
  * ✓ Features Map & System Logic │ ✓ Development Plan & Testing Milestones
  * ✓ Pilot Development & Testing │ ✓ Plan for Launch & Promotion
  * ★ PILOT DEMONSTRATION
* **Day 4 - EVALUATING & REFINING SOLUTIONS**
  * Driving Question for Students: How effective is your solution and how will you improve it?
  * ✓ Pilot Evaluation │ ✓ Final Release Development
  * ✓ Final Release Launch and Promotion │ ✓ Poster Design
  * ✓ Individual Reflections │ ✓ Presentation Plan & Practice
  * ★ FINAL DEMONSTRATION & PRESENTATION
* **Day 5 - FILLING IN THE GAPS & WRAPPING UP YOUR WEEKS WORK**
  * A classroom plan to facilitate a computer science course.
  * Three artifacts from the project activities that you created through the course of the workshop. These can serve as examples of work for students while giving you first-hand experience of fulfilling the expectations you may have of your students.

## Workshop Prep

* **Computer - You'll definitely need a notebook computer, but there is no need for any special software.** You can complete all activities using browser-based platforms that are free. Of course you can use other software that you prefer as well, and if you want to bring a physical device, like a robot or IoT kit, please do.
* **Project Context - We highly recommended that you come to the workshop with a specific classroom project in mind (or two).** **For example, one of the** [**six Computing by Design projects**](https://docs.idew.org/the-cxd-framework/). Hopefully you were able to take a programming workshop beforehand but no specific programming experience is required. We can adapt to meet your needs. Feel free to bring any related hardware you would like — like robots or IoT kits.
